title:Setting the stage: Building and maintaining a habitable world and the early conditions that could favor life's beginnings on Earth and beyond
The Hadean, once thought to be uninhabitable and tumultuous, has more recently been recontextualized as a clement time in which oceans, land, and life likely appeared on Earth. This non-exhaustive chapter follows multiple threads from planet formation to the origin of life. We place significant emphasis on the solar system context for the Earth, the timing and nature of crustal formation and the evolution of the surface and atmosphere. Several scenarios for prebiotic chemistry are also discussed including atmospheric photochemistry, wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles, and hydrothermal vent systems. We attempt to draw connections between the large-scale, planetary processes and various origin of life pathways to illustrate possible overlaps and correlations. In detail, we conclude with and discuss the "impact of impacts" to show how asteroid and comet impacts during the Hadean may have affected many of these processes and scenarios, from generating land to altering the chemical composition and oxidation state of the early Earth's atmosphere and surface.

title:Diversities and similarities exhibited by multi-planetary systems and their architectures: I. Orbital spacings
The rich diversity of multi-planetary systems and their architectures is greatly contrasted by the uniformity exhibited within many of these systems. Previous studies have shown that compact Kepler systems tend to exhibit a peas-in-a-pod architecture: Planets in the same system tend to have similar sizes and masses and be regularly spaced in orbits with low eccentricities and mutual inclinations. This work extends on previous research and examines a larger and more diverse sample comprising all the systems with a minimum of three confirmed planets, resulting in 282 systems and 991 planets. We investigated the system architectures, focusing on the orbital spacings between adjacent planets as well as their relationships with the planets' sizes and masses. We also quantified the similarities of the sizes, masses, and spacings of planets within each system, conducting both intra- and inter-system analyses. Our results corroborate previous research showing that planets orbiting the same star tend to be regularly spaced and that pairs of adjacent planets with radii<1 R_Earth predominantly have orbital period ratios (PRs)<2. In contrast to other studies, we identified a significant similarity of adjacent orbital spacings not only at PRs<4 but also at 1.17<PRs<2662. For the systems with transiting planets, we additionally found that the reported correlation between the PRs and the sizes of adjacent planets disappears when planet pairs with R<1 R_Earth are excluded. Furthermore, we examined the data for possible correlations between the intra-system dispersions of orbital spacings and those of the planetary radii and masses. Our findings indicate that these dispersions are uncorrelated for the systems in which all planet pairs have PRs<6, and even for the compact systems where all PRs<2. Notably, planets in the same system can be similarly spaced even if they do not have similar masses or sizes.

title:Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Luminosity and Mass as Limits to Growth
Earth remains the only known example of a planet with technology, and future projections of Earth's trajectory provide a basis and motivation for approaching the search for extraterrestrial technospheres. Conventional approaches toward projecting Earth's technosphere include applications of the Kardashev scale, which suggest the possibility that energy-intensive civilizations may expand to harness the entire energy output available to their planet, host star, or even the entire galaxy. In this study, we argue that the Kardashev scale is better understood as a "luminosity limit" that describes the maximum capacity for a civilization to harvest luminous stellar energy across a given spatial domain, and we note that thermodynamic efficiency will always keep a luminosity-limited technosphere from actually reaching this theoretical limit. We suggest the possibility that an advanced technosphere might evolve beyond this luminosity limit to draw its energy directly from harvesting stellar mass, and we also discuss possible trajectories that could exist between Earth today and such hypothetical "stellivores." We develop a framework to describe trajectories for long-lived technospheres that optimize their growth strategies between exploration and exploitation, unlike Earth today. We note that analyses of compact accreting stars could provide ways to test the stellivore hypothesis, and we more broadly suggest an expansion of technosignature search strategies beyond those that reside exactly at the luminosity limit.

title:Radiatively Active Clouds and Magnetic Effects Explored in a Grid of Hot Jupiter GCMs
Cloud formation and magnetic effects are both expected to significantly impact the structures and observable properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres. For some hot Jupiters, thermal ionization and condensation can coexist in a single atmosphere, and both processes are important. We present a grid of general circulation models across a wide range of irradiation temperatures with and without incorporating the effects of magnetism and cloud formation to investigate how these processes work in tandem. We find that clouds are present in the atmosphere at all modeled irradiation temperatures, while magnetic effects are negligible for planets with irradiation temperatures cooler than 2000 K. At and above this threshold, clouds and magnetic fields shape atmospheres together, with mutual feedback. Models that include magnetism, through their influence on the temperature structure, produce more longitudinally symmetric dayside cloud coverage and more equatorially concentrated clouds on the nightside and morning terminator. To indicate how these processes would affect observables, we generate bolometric thermal and reflected phase curves from these models. The combination of clouds and magnetic effects increases thermal phase curve amplitudes and decreases peak offsets more than either process does individually.

title:Imaging of the Vega Debris System using JWST/MIRI
We present images of the Vega planetary debris disk obtained at 15.5, 23, and 25.5 microns with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on JWST. The debris system is remarkably symmetric and smooth, and centered accurately on the star. There is a broad Kuiper-belt-analog ring at 80 to 170 au that coincides with the planetesimal belt detected with ALMA at 1.34 mm. The interior of the broad belt is filled with warm debris that shines most efficiently at mid-infrared along with a shallow flux dip/gap at 60 au from the star. These qualitative characteristics argue against any Saturn-mass planets orbiting the star outside of about 10 au assuming the unseen planet would be embedded in the very broad planetesimal disk from a few to hundred au. We find that the distribution of dust detected interior to the broad outer belt is consistent with grains being dragged inward by the Poynting-Robertson effect. Tighter constraints can be derived for planets in specific locations, for example any planet shepherding the inner edge of the outer belt is likely to be less than 6 Earth masses. The disk surface brightness profile along with the available infrared photometry suggest a disk inner edge near 3-5 au, disconnected from the sub-au region that gives rise to the hot near-infrared excess. The gap between the hot, sub-au zone and the inner edge of the warm debris might be shepherded by a modest mass, Neptune-size planet.

title:Ultraviolet Photometry and Habitable Zones of Over 2700 Planet-Hosting Stars
The ongoing discovery of exoplanets has sparked significant interest in finding suitable worlds that could potentially support life. Stellar ultraviolet (UV; 100-3000 Ã…) radiation may play a crucial role in determining the habitability of their planets. In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis of the UV photometry of over 2700 host stars with confirmed planets, using observational data from the GALEX and Swift UVOT missions. We performed aperture photometry on single-exposure images, and provided photometric catalogs that can be used to explore a wide range of scientific questions, such as stellar UV activity and planet habitability. By calculating the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) and UV habitable zone (UHZ), we found that fewer than 100 exoplanets fall within both of these zones, with the majority being gas giants. We also examined stellar activity based on their far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) emissions. We found the FUV$-$NUV color more effectively represents stellar activity compared to the $R^{\prime}_{\rm FUV}$ and $R^{\prime}_{\rm NUV}$ indices. The Sun's low FUV emission and moderate NUV emission highlight its uniqueness among (solar-like) stars.

title:Database of Candidate Targets for the LIFE Mission
We present the database of potential targets for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE), a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer mission proposed for the Voyage 2050 science program of the European Space Agency (ESA). The database features stars, their planets and disks, main astrophysical parameters, and ancillary observations. It allows users to create target lists based on various criteria to predict, for instance, exoplanet detection yields for the LIFE mission. As such, it enables mission design trade-offs, provides context for the analysis of data obtained by LIFE, and flags critical missing data. Work on the database is in progress, but given its relevance to LIFE and other space missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), we present its main features here. A preliminary version of the LIFE database is publicly available on the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO).

title:Deneb and the alpha Cygni Variables
Deneb, the prototype alpha Cygni variable, is a blue-white supergiant that shows irregular variability with quasi-period around 12 days in brightness and radial velocity. Abt et al. (2023) found that larger amplitude 12-day variations appear to resume abruptly and at an arbitrary phase and damp out after several cycles, with an interval of around 70 days between these resumptions. Here we make use of an 8.6-year photometric data set for Deneb from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) to better characterize this behavior. We find that the interval between pulsation resumptions is not exact, with the most common intervals between 100 and 120 days. Sometimes one or more intervals are skipped. We also examine AAVSO and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves for alpha Cyg variables Rigel, Saiph, and Alnilam in Orion, Aludra in Canis Major, and 6 Cas to compare with the behavior of alpha Cyg. Except for 6 Cas, the time series are too short, or the observations too infrequent to draw any conclusions about similarities between the behavior of these stars and alpha Cyg. We also summarize results of evolution and pulsation modeling for Deneb and alpha Cyg variables from the literature. The alpha Cyg variables may not be a homogenous group with a common mechanism for their variability. It has not been determined whether they are on the first crossing of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram toward the red supergiant phase or are on their second crossing after having been red supergiants. Future plans include examining BRITE Constellation data for Deneb, processing SMEI data for other bright alpha Cyg variables, and comparing 6 Cas light curves from AAVSO and TESS data taken concurrently.

title:An Overview of Solar Orbiter Observations of Interplanetary Shocks in Solar Cycle 25
Interplanetary shocks are fundamental constituents of the heliosphere, where they form as a result of solar activity. We use previously unavailable measurements of interplanetary shocks in the inner heliosphere provided by Solar Orbiter, and present a survey of the first 100 shocks observed in situ at different heliocentric distances during the rising phase of solar cycle 25. The fundamental shock parameters (shock normals, shock normal angles, shock speeds, compression ratios, Mach numbers) have been estimated and studied as a function of heliocentric distance, revealing a rich scenario of configurations. Comparison with large surveys of shocks at 1~au show that shocks in the quasi-parallel regime and with high speed are more commonly observed in the inner heliosphere. The wave environment of the shocks has also been addressed, with about 50\% of the events exhibiting clear shock-induced upstream fluctuations. We characterize energetic particle responses to the passage of IP shocks at different energies, often revealing complex features arising from the interaction between IP shocks and pre-existing fluctuations, including solar wind structures being processed upon shock crossing. Finally, we give details and guidance on the access use of the present survey, available on the EU-project ``solar energetic particle analysis platform for the inner heliosphere'' (SERPENTINE) website. The algorithm used to identify shocks in large datasets, now publicly available, is also described.

title:Deep Search for a scattered light dust halo around Vega with the Hubble Space Telescope
We present a provisory scattered light detection of the Vega debris disk using deep Hubble Space Telescope coronagraphy (PID 16666). At only 7.7 parsecs, Vega is immensely important in debris disk studies both for its prominence and also because it allows the highest physical resolution among all debris systems relative to temperature zones around the star. We employ the STIS coronagraph's widest wedge position and classical Reference Differential Imaging to achieve among the lowest surface brightness sensitivities to date ($\sim 4\,\mu Jy/arcsec^{2}$) at wide separations using 32 orbits in Cycle 29. We detect a halo extending from the inner edge of our effective inner working angle at $10^{\prime\prime}.5$ out to the photon noise floor at $30^{\prime\prime}$ (80 - 230 au). The face-on orientation of the system and the lack of a perfectly color-matched PSF star have provided significant challenges to the reductions, particularly regarding artifacts from the imperfect color matching. However, we find that a halo of small dust grains provides the best explanation for the observed signal. Unlike Fomalhaut (a close twin to Vega in luminosity, distance, and age), there is no clear distinction in scattered light between the parent planetesimal belt observed with ALMA and the extended dust halo. These HST observations complement JWST GTO Cycle 1 observations of the system with NIRCam and MIRI.

title:Inconsistencies in Simple Thermal Model Results for Near-Earth Asteroids between Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX and NEOWISE Data
Understanding the properties of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is key for many aspects of planetary science, particularly planetary defense. Our current knowledge of NEA sizes and regolith properties is heavily dependent on simple thermal models. These models are often used to analyze data from missions such as NEOWISE because they are well suited to deal with large volumes of data. However, simple model results based on NEOWISE data may be inconsistent with results based on other types of observation in some cases. In this work, we seek to better understand these potential inconsistencies, as well as the situations for which they are most prevalent. We do this by comparing simple model results based on Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX data to similar results based on NEOWISE data. This is carried out for six NEAs that represent a range of spectral types, shapes, and rotation states. We find that models based on SpeX and NEOWISE data for these six objects are inconsistent in some cases, even though the SpeX results are consistent with other methods and observations. We find that objects observed at fainter magnitudes and objects with more primitive compositions are more likely to produce inconsistent fits. These results highlight the importance of better understanding the limitations of simple models as applied to large survey data sets like NEOWISE. This is particularly true as we move into an era where our understanding of the NEA population will be dominated by future large surveys such as NEO Surveyor.

title:On the time-dependent density of quadratically coupled dark matter around ordinary matter objects
Wave-like dark matter may feature quadratic couplings to ordinary matter. This carries profound consequences for the phenomenologies of such models. It changes the dark matter density around dense objects made from ordinary matter such as planets and stars, thereby changing the sensitivity of direct detection experiments on Earth as well as implying forces on other ordinary matter objects in the vicinity. In this note we study the time dependence of the dark matter field around spherical objects of ordinary matter. This work indicates the time-scale on which accelerating objects settle into a stationary state and delineates the applicability of stationary solutions for experimental dark matter tests. We also use this to understand (and effectively eliminate) the infinities in energies, forces, and pressures that appear when naively comparing the total energy around objects with different size but the same total number of ordinary matter particles.
